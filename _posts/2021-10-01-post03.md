## Recap

* We have added 3 posts along with 2 default pages by Jekyll demo site
* We have two sites locally and remotely deployed by `git commands`
* We have fixed a difficult bug about the missing `main.css` and recovered
* The source dir tree is very clean as below and newbie-friendly kudos to Jekyll's philosophy (gets out of your way)
```
$ git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD 
.gitignore
404.html
Gemfile
Gemfile.lock
_config.yml
_posts/2021-09-28-post01.md
_posts/2021-09-28-post02.md
_posts/2021-09-29-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown
_posts/2021-10-01-post03.md
about.markdown
index.markdown
```
* So far no knowledge of HTML, CSS, or Javascript is needed

## Basic skills learned:
* Jekyll commands, a one liner
* Git commands, with global aliases to save us some typing
* Markdown format, especially Relative links, to hyper-link posts and web urls among posts and other sites

### Git Alias Commands

From [tania blog] I learned git aliases which saves me a lot of typing. In MacOS, edit ~/.gitconfig under your home directory as below.

~/.gitconfig
```
[alias]
  a      = add
  ca     = commit -a
  cam    = commit -am
  cm     = commit -m
  s      = status
  pom    = push origin master
  pog    = push origin gh-pages
  puom   = pull origin master
  puog   = pull origin gh-pages
  cob    = checkout -b
  co     = checkout
  fp     = fetch --prune --all
  l      = log --oneline --decorate --graph
  lall   = log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
  ls     = log --oneline --decorate --graph --stat
  lt     = log --graph --decorate --pretty=format:'%C(yellow)%h%Creset%C(auto)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)%an%Creset'
  tree   = ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD
```

With git global aliases in place (i,e. `~/.gitconfig`), we can do
* git s  # for git status
* git a .  # for git add .
* git cm "initial commit"  # for git commit "initial commit"
* git cob gh-pages  # for git checkout -b gh-pages
* git pog  # for git push origin gh-pages
* git l  # for a one-line logs

### Relative Links in Markdown

Links (or hyperlinks) in a post provides more information without distracting the main flow. There are two kinds of url's,
relative and absolute. For a web site hosting many tutorial posts, using Relative Links to refer one another is basic.

A markdown link consists of two parts, description and url. For example [Post01] and [Post02], we put a description inside [] and followed by a relative url inside ().

Footnotes are also another kine of links, i.e., See markdown cheat sheet at [^1].

#### Jekyll style of relative links
  * /jekyll/2021/09/28/ is actual a subdirectory Jekyll builds under _site/
  * /jekyll/ is picked up because Front Matter has categories: jekyll
  * /21021/09/28/ is the standard naming convention of posts in Jekyll

#### Alternative way of grouping relative links together

We can put all `[desc](links)` links at the bottom of posts (so they are well organized), and use [desc] in markdown files.
```
# at the end of a post

```

## Advance skills learned - staging development

It may not be obvious to a newbie, but [Post01] has taught us an advanced skill:

 - development and test at local site
 - publish the production content at remote site
 - edit posts or write new posts; see the result at local site; then deploy to the remote site (so called CI/CD practice)

The concept of staging development and CI/CD is of great value for a developer-to-be.
