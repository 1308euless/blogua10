## Recap

* We have posted two articles [Post01] and [Post02] on top of Jekyll demo site
* We have two sites locally and remotely deployed by `git commands`
* We have fixed a difficult bug and recovered the missing `main.css`

Our next big challange is to replace minima theme with taiwindcss, so we can add to our sites with features like
* mobile first
* navigation
* sidebar or TOC (Table of Content)
* maybe a little bit of PWA (Progressive Web App)

But hold on, let us not get too far ahead of ourselves. We shall learn two basic skills first:
* Git commands, with global aliases to save us some typing
* Relative links, to hyper-link posts and web urls among posts and other sites

## Git Alias Commands

I like [tania blog] and I learned the below aliases from it too. In MacOS ~/.gitconfig is under your home directory.

~/.gitconfig
```
[alias]
  a      = add
  ca     = commit -a
  cam    = commit -am
  cm     = commit -m
  s      = status
  pom    = push origin master
  pog    = push origin gh-pages
  puom   = pull origin master
  puog   = pull origin gh-pages
  cob    = checkout -b
  co     = checkout
  fp     = fetch --prune --all
  l      = log --oneline --decorate --graph
  lall   = log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
  ls     = log --oneline --decorate --graph --stat
  lt     = log --graph --decorate --pretty=format:'%C(yellow)%h%Creset%C(auto)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)%an%Creset'
```

With git global aliases in place (i,e. `~/.gitconfig`), we can do
* git s  # for git status
* git a .  # for git add .
* git cm "initial commit"  # for git commit "initial commit"
* git cob gh-pages  # for git checkout -b gh-pages
* git pog  # for git push origin gh-pages
* git l  # for a one-line logs

## Relative Links

Note we do not want to use absolute url to refer to posts as we want our references to work both locally and remotely.

For a web site hosting many tutorial posts, using Relative Links to refer one another is basic.
For example [Post01] and [Post02], we put a description inside [] and followed by a relative link inside ().
```
[post](/jekyll/2021/09/28/post01.html)
```

### Jekyll style of relative links
  * /jekyll/2021/09/28/ is actual a subdirectory Jekyll builds under _site/
  * /jekyll/ is picked up because Front Matter has categories: jekyll
  * /21021/09/28/ is the standard naming convention of posts in Jekyll

### Alternative way of specifying relative links

We can put all `[desc](links)` links at the bottom of posts (so they are well organized), and use [desc] in markdown files.
