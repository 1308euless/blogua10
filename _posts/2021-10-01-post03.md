## Relative links

For a web site hosting many tutorial posts, using Relative Links to refer one another is basic.
For example [Post01] and [Post02]

To refer to Post01 from Post03, we simply say [Post01] followed by /jekyll/2021/09/28/post01.html, enclosed it in ().
  * /jekyll/2021/09/28/ is actual a subdirectory Jekyll builds under _site/
  * /jekyll/ is picked up because Front Matter has categories: jekyll
  * /21021/09/28/ is the standard naming convention of posts in Jekyll

Note we do not want to use absolute url here as we want our references to work both locally and remotely.

[Post01]: /jekyll/2021/09/28/post01.html
[Post02]: /jekyll/2021/09/28/post02.html
