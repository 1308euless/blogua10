### Code review on index.md
```
# index.md
---
Layout: home
---
```

Index.md is the landing page of our blog site. It comes with Jekyll. It is up to us to change it so we can have our own landing page. For this tutorial, we will stay simple and not modify it. It has no content, only one line of Front Matter. It tells Jekyll to use `home Layout`.
