## Handling 404 error status

Coming from [Post01](/jekyll/2021/09/28/post01.html), our remote site has all content as the local site but no layout.
Enabling browser inspect mode (Command-Option-i) with Network tab, there are three errors reading
* http://localhost:4000/
* main.css
* minima-social-icons.svg

The error message: Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404

You can see [the example error site](https://kuolai.gitgub.io/blogua07) here.

### Fixing a remote bug from local repo

In order for gh-pages to work, _config.yml/baseurl cannot be empty. 

_config.yml
```
baseurl: ""
```
needs to change to
```
baseurl: "blogua10"
```
##### Note: Either blogua10 or /blogua10 works

$ git commit -am "update baseurl in _config.yml"

$ git push origin gh-pages

No more errors and Jekyll demo site with style shown.

### Verify the remote patch at local site, but FAILED

Stop Jekyll server with Ctl-C and restart it. Browser at localhost:4000, and our local site has no style and with three errors. A bug fixed at remote site caused a new bug at local site!!!

A temporary patch is with local override command:

$ bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ""

### Conclusion

In order for remote sites to work on github gh-pages branch, _config.yml needs baseurl: "blogua10". However, for
a local site (localhost:4000) to work, baseurl needs to be empty (""). Since we want single source tree that is
identical locally and remotely, we keep baseurl: "blogua10" in _config.yml but use a terminal command to override it.

$ bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ""  # override baseurl 

Maybe I shall file an issue and have it fixed. 2021/09/30
