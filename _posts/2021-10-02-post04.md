## Layout of a post

This post (and other posts too) you are reading at has three sections:
 * Header, at the top, serves as navigation
 * Main section, the content 
 * Footer

 For tutorial purpose to keep things simple, both Header and Footer are intentionally unmodified as is in Jekyll demo.

## A peek at Jekyll magic

When we start a local server with `bundle exec jekyll serve`, jekyll does
 - Find all .md files in root dir (index.md, about.md) and in _posts/ dir (Post0x.md)
 - [Front Matter] of each file will tell Jekyll how to convert `.md` to `.html` file with a default style
 - Store all .html files are in `_site/`
 - _site/index.html is the [Home Page] displayed by the browser, which list the post headings
 - Click Post04 which bring us to this page

It is magic to me without writing a line of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript that we have a real blog site.
