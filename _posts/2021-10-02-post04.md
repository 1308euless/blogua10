## Layout of a post

This post (and other posts too) you are reading at has three sections:
 * Header, at the top, serves as navigation. Intentionally unmodified as Jekyll demo.
 * Main section, where the content shows
 * Footer, Intentionally unmodified as Jekyll demo.

## No HTML CSS JS (so far)

We have a home page [Post01] with index to four posts created by us and a potential to unlimited posts.
It felt like a job only web developers can do, but we did not use HTML, CSS, Javascript; instead, we use Jekyll and makrdown:

 - Markdown syntax is easy to learn (learn by example). Jekyll turns .markdown (or .md) files to .html and .scss files for browsers to display.
 - Most posts are similar in layout and style, and Jekyll organizes them and put out an index in the home page.
 - The layout and font style is in `main.css` with source code called [minima theme] more at [Post05]
