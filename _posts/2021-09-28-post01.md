## Post01 Overview

We are going to use Jekyll demo blog site (hence no effort for content creation) to
* Build a project tree locally
* Use Jekyll serve command to start a local server, and browser url `localhost:4000` to show the site
* Create an empty repo with browser url `github.com/new` and name the repo `blogua10`
  ##### Note: When creating repo, no description, no README. We will do everything from local repo and push over.
  ##### Note: Eventually your remote website url will be at kuolai.gitgub.io/blogua10 with gh-pages branch (not main branch)
* Local git commit (since we have local site shown and proven)
* Local branch set up as gh-pages
* Connect remote repo and name it "origin"
* Git push origin gh-pages (push gh-pages branch to origin/gh-pages)
* Github will automactically host your gh-pages site
* Browser url at kuolai.gitgub.io/blogua10
* Compare local and remote sites

### Start a new jekyll project called blogua10 locally

  $ jekyll new blogua10

  $ cd blogua10

  $ bundle add webrick  # needed for Ruby version 3.0.0 or higher

### Initialize the project dir as a git repo

$ git init

$ git status  # standard jekyll demo site has two markdown files and one post file under _posts/
```
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	.gitignore
	404.html
	Gemfile
	Gemfile.lock
	_config.yml
	_posts/
	about.markdown
	index.markdown
```

### Remote repo

Create a new repository from your browser at github.com/new. Name it `blogua10`. Leave everything empty. We will push to this remote repo from local repo. At local termimal,

### Connect to remote repo

$ git remote add origin https://github.com/kuolai/blogua10.git

$ git checkout -b gh-pages  # change local branch to gh-pages

$ git add .  # track all files

$ git commit -m "Initial commit"  # we did not modify anything

$ git push origin gh-pages  # push to remote repo at remote branch gh-pages (created automatically)

### Remote web site: `kuolai.github.io/blogua10`

Now you shall see a standard jekyll demo page.

### Local web site: Localhost:4000

$ bundle exec jekyll serve
And go to `localhost:4000` with local browser

### Conclusion: Compare two web sites

Both sites have identical project tree and content, but remote site has no layout. You can see [site with no layout] here. 
See [Post02] for more explanations and fixes.
