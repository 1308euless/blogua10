## Post01 Overview

We are going to create a web site at two locations, local and remote. The local web site is for test and development; and the remote site is for production site to publish contents. We use [Jekyll] demo blog project and [Git] for version control.
This post [Post01] (2nd post of this tutorial, first post come along with `Jekyll new` command) is created in Oct. 2021 with [Markdown] format.

### Summary of steps
* Build a project tree locally
* Use Jekyll serve command to start a local server, and browser url `localhost:4000` to show the site
* Create an empty repo with browser url `github.com/new` and name the repo `blogua10`
  ##### Note: When creating repo, no description, no README. We will do everything from local repo and push over.
  ##### Note: Eventually your remote website url will be at kuolai.gitgub.io/blogua10 with gh-pages branch (not main branch)
* Local git commit (since we have local site shown and proven)
* Local branch set up as `gh-pages`
* Connect remote repo and name it `origin`
* Git push origin gh-pages (push gh-pages branch to origin/gh-pages)
* Github will automactically host your gh-pages site
* Browser url at `kuolai.gitgub.io/blogua10`
* Compare local and remote sites

### Start a new jekyll project called blogua10 locally

  $ jekyll new blogua10

  $ cd blogua10

  $ bundle add webrick  # needed for Ruby version 3.0.0 or higher

### Start local server

$ bundle exec jekyll serve

### Browsing local web site: `Localhost:4000`

Type `localhost:4000` with local browser and you shall see a Jekyll demo site

### Initialize the project dir as a git repo

$ git init

$ git status  # standard jekyll demo site has two markdown files and one post file under _posts/
```
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	.gitignore
	404.html
	Gemfile
	Gemfile.lock
	_config.yml
	_posts/
	about.markdown
	index.markdown
```

### Remote repo

Create a new repository from your browser at github.com/new. Name it `blogua10`. Leave everything empty. We will push to this remote repo from local repo. At local termimal,

### Connect to remote repo

$ git remote add origin https://github.com/kuolai/blogua10.git

$ git checkout -b gh-pages  # change local branch to gh-pages

$ git add .  # track all files

$ git commit -m "Initial commit"  # we did not modify anything

$ git push origin gh-pages  # push to remote repo at remote branch gh-pages (created automatically)

### Browsing remote web site: `kuolai.github.io/blogua10`

Now you shall see a standard jekyll demo page.

### Conclusion: Remote site deployed but looked different with the same content

Both two sites have identical project tree and content, but remote site has no layout. You can see [site with no layout] here. See [Post02] for more explanations and fixes.

Even though our remote site does not look like a Jekyll demo site. We have made a remote repo and showed the site in gh-pages branch.
